Simulink Blocks:-

Constant Block: used to generate Constant value signal.

Display Block: used to show (visualize) results numerically by displaying signals.

Sum Block: used to add or subtract input signals.

Gain Block: used to modify a signal by multiplying input signals by a constant.

Product Block: used to multiply input signals.

Scope Block: used to show (visualize) results graphically "Waves".

subsystem Block: used to contain a subset of a model.

Mux Block: used to combine inputs with the same data type and complexity into a virtual vector.

Demux Block: used to extract the components of an input vector signal and output separate signals. The output signal ports are ordered from top to bottom.
