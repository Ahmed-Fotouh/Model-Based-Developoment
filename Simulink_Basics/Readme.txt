Simulink Bloks:-

Constant Block: used to generate Constant value signal.
Display Block: used to show (visualize) results numerically by displaying signals.
Sum Block: used to add or subtract input signals.
Gain Block: used to modify a signal by multiplying input signals by a constant.
Product Block: used to multiply input signals.
Scope: used to show (visualize) results graphically "Waves".
subsystem: used to contain a subset of a model.
Mux block: used to combine inputs with the same data type and complexity into a virtual vector
Demux block: used to extract the components of an input vector signal and output separate signals. The output signal ports are ordered from top to bottom.
